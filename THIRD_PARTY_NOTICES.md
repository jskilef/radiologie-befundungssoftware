# Third-party licenses and attribution

Reviewed for Report Studio 1.5.0 on 5 October 2026.

## What the release contains

Report Studio's original code, documentation, templates, and project assets are
provided under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Copyright (c) 2026 jskilef and
Report Studio contributors. Preserve that notice and the license when sharing
copies or substantial portions. The standalone HTML includes the full MIT text.

The release ZIP contains the application, launcher, documentation, verification
scripts, icons, blank settings example, and license documents. It contains no
third-party runtime implementation, model weights, Node.js executable, browser,
or cloud-provider SDK. The launcher uses Node.js built-ins. Optional browser-local
inference downloads third-party runtimes and model assets on demand; these are
separate works with their own terms, not relicensed under the project's MIT license.

## Runtime components referenced by the application

| Component | Version / source | License and included text |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WebLLM, MLC-AI | [`@mlc-ai/web-llm` 0.2.85](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/tree/v0.2.85) | Apache-2.0; [upstream LICENSE including its attribution appendix](licenses/web-llm-0.2.85-LICENSE.txt) |
| OpenAI API protocol definitions within WebLLM | [Upstream copy shipped with WebLLM 0.2.85](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/blob/v0.2.85/licenses/license.openai_node.txt) | Apache-2.0; [upstream text](licenses/web-llm-openai-protocols-LICENSE.txt). This is not a dependency on the OpenAI SDK in Report Studio. |
| Transformers.js, Hugging Face | [`@huggingface/transformers` 3.8.1](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js/tree/3.8.1) | Apache-2.0; [upstream text](licenses/transformers-js-3.8.1-LICENSE.txt) |
| ONNX Runtime Web, Microsoft and contributors | `1.22.0-dev.20250409-89f8206ba4`, declared in [Transformers.js 3.8.1](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js/blob/3.8.1/package.json) | MIT; [Microsoft copyright and license](licenses/onnxruntime-LICENSE.txt), plus the [upstream third-party notice collection](licenses/onnxruntime-ThirdPartyNotices.txt) |

WebLLM's published bundle also incorporates runtime/tokenizer/grammar components
and references dependencies such as loglevel. Transformers.js incorporates or
loads additional dependencies such as Hugging Face Jinja and ONNX Runtime's
components. Their own upstream copyright and license notices remain applicable.
The table identifies the integrations used here; it is not an assertion that
every transitive component of a future CDN download has been audited or has the
same license. WebLLM's repository has no root NOTICE file at the reviewed tag;
its LICENSE appendix and referenced protocol license are retained here.

The app pins the top-level JavaScript runtime versions. It does not pin every
model revision or every CDN-resolved transitive asset. The model revisions below
are the revisions inspected for this notice, not new runtime download pins.

## Development test tools

The optional browser test setup pins `@playwright/test`, `playwright`, and
`playwright-core` to 1.63.0 through `pnpm-lock.yaml`. These Microsoft projects use
[Apache-2.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/v1.63.0/LICENSE).
They are development dependencies installed separately; their implementation
and downloaded test browsers are not included in the release ZIP or standalone
HTML. Installed packages retain their upstream license and notice files.

At inspection, the MLC and ONNX conversion repositories above did not contain
their own LICENSE file or license metadata. Their cards identify the original
Qwen models; the original publisher's license files are included as evidence for
those original weights, not as a blanket clearance of all converted artifacts.
SmolLM2 declares its license in model-card metadata without a separate LICENSE
file. Model weights are not redistributed in this release.

## Redistribution and services

- When sharing Report Studio, retain its MIT copyright/license and these notices.
- If you later vendor, mirror, modify, or bundle runtime packages, WASM libraries,
  tokenizer assets, or weights, inspect the exact artifacts first. Include their
  complete licenses, relevant upstream NOTICE files and attribution, identify
  modifications, and meet any additional source/distribution obligations. Merely
  including this integration inventory is not a substitute for that review.
- The ONNX Runtime notice collection is preserved verbatim for reference. It
  describes upstream components; it does not imply that all listed components
  are used by this app or that Report Studio is subject to every listed license.
- API requests are implemented directly. OpenAI, Gemini, and other configured
  services retain their own service/account terms; an open-source application
  license does not grant API access or replace those terms.
- Licenses grant software/model permissions, not clinical validation, regulatory
  approval, trademark rights, or permission to disclose patient information.

The [source inventory](licenses/SOURCES.json) records the URLs and SHA-256 hashes
of the included upstream license documents. No upstream license text is modified.

## MedGemma and additional runtime

Experimental MedGemma text-only inference uses [Transformers.js 4.3.0](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js/tree/4.3.0), Apache-2.0; [upstream license](licenses/transformers-js-4.3.0-LICENSE.txt). MedGemma uses the third-party [geeek/medgemma-4b-it-ONNX](https://huggingface.co/geeek/medgemma-4b-it-ONNX) conversion of [google/medgemma-4b-it](https://huggingface.co/google/medgemma-4b-it), governed by the [Health AI Developer Foundations terms](https://developers.google.com/health-ai-developer-foundations/terms). It is not licensed under Report Studio's MIT license. No weights are redistributed in this release. Users must review and comply with upstream terms before downloading or using them. Local model folders and compiled libraries remain separately supplied works.
